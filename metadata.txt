name=JD Boundary Uploader
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=JD Boundary Uploader is a QGIS plugin designed to streamline the process of importing and preparing boundary shapefiles for upload to the John Deere Operations Center. The plugin automatically extracts and reprojects shapefiles from ZIP archives provided from FADQ and provides an interactive editing interface where users can update attributes such as Client Name, Farm Name, and Field Name. It supports grouping and merging of fields. Finally, JD Boundary Uploader generates a fully packaged ZIP archive—including the shapefile and a metadata JSON file—that meets the required format for John Deere Operations Center uploads.
